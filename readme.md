# Introduction Of Project
The Pomodoro Technique is a simple time-management method designed to help you focus better and avoid burnout.

## It works like this:

1. Pick a task you want to work on.<br>

2. Set a timer for 25 minutes (this is called one Pomodoro).<br>

3. Work with full focus until the timer rings ‚Äî no distractions.<br>

4. Take a short break (about 5 minutes).<br>

5. After every 4 Pomodoros, take a longer break (about 15‚Äì30 minutes).<br>


## Why it works:

25 minutes feels short enough to commit to without procrastinating.<br>

Frequent breaks keep your brain fresh and prevent mental fatigue.<br>

The timer creates a sense of urgency and focus.<br>

You can track how many Pomodoros you‚Äôve done to measure progress.<br>

## schedule :
Work: 25 min ‚Üí Break: 5 min  <br>
Work: 25 min ‚Üí Break: 5 min  <br>
Work: 25 min ‚Üí Break: 5 min  <br>
Work: 25 min ‚Üí Long Break: 20 min<br>

Fun fact: Pomodoro is Italian for ‚Äútomato‚Äù üçÖ ‚Äî the inventor, Francesco Cirillo, used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer in the late 1980s.
